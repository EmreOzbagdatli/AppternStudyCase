## Requirements
- An iOS device or simulator running iOS 13.0 or later.
- Swift 5.0 or newer.
- Cocoapods package manager.
## Technologies
- Swift
- UIkit
- MVC
- RESTful API
- Kingfisher
- AVFoundation
## Usage
- Upon launching the project, the main screen will appear. You can search for music using the search bar. The search results will be displayed in a list format. Upon selecting a track, a music preview will start playing, and the music player interface will be presented at the bottom of the screen.
## Favorites and User Defaults
- In this project, a favorites functionality is implemented using User Defaults to store the user's preferred tracks. When a user selects a track as a favorite, it will be saved in User Defaults. The favorites can be accessed and managed within the application's interface.
